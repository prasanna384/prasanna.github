            <h3>Gowtham GM</h3>  
            <p>A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team. I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.</p>  
            <p>I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.</p>  
            <p>Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.</p>  
            <p>Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.</p>

            <p>Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos. They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.</p>

            <p>I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my experience with Tap Academy. They visited our college in Tamil Nadu and selected students for their CSR batch, offering a free course that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to other academies, Tap Academy stands out for its excellent trainers, who explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, start from scratch, making it easy for beginners to understand, and provide in-depth coverage of programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for placement opportunities.</p>  
            <p>I'm grateful to have been selected by Avasoft with the role of Trainee Engineer with a package of 5 LPA through college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible teaching, as I used the same approach they taught me during the mock interview process.</p>  
            <p>Additionally, Tap Academy offers comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an LMS platform with daily class recordings, a TAI platform for practicing daily programming questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock assessments and Interviews, boosting placement confidence, as well as soft skill classes focusing on logical thinking.</p>
